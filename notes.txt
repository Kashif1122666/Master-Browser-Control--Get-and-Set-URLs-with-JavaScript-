chapter 76: Browser control - Getting and setting the url 

1. Getting the full URL 
     In javascript , you can easily check the full URL of the page you're on using the window.
     location.href property.

     var currentURL = window.location.href;
     console.log(currentURL);
     this shows the complete web address.

2. Breaking the url into parts
     you can extract specific parts of the url:

        Domain Name (e.g www.example.com):
        var domain = window.location.hostname; 
        console.log(domain);

        patname(e.g., /product/page33.html):
           var path = window.location.pathname;
           console.log(path);

        Anchor (e.g., #humidifier):   
           var anchor = window.location.hash;
           console.log(anchor);

3.Setting  a new url          
          you can also tell the Browser to go to a new url:
            window.location.href = "https:/www.newsite.com";

          you can even use the current domain to navigate within the smae site:  
            var newPage = "http://" + window.location.hostname + "/newpage.html";
            window.location.href = newPage;

Summary: The window.location object is your key for controlling the Browser's url, allowing            
you to get parts  of the url or even navigate to  a new one!
